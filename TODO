- Optimize static strings
- Improve interface to compile options (formatting, etc.)
- Refactor compiler

NOTE: This package is currently restricted to q version 1.0.1 to maintain
compatibility with Semo; but the code could be refactored to work with a
different promise libraries, as was done for json-promise etc.
